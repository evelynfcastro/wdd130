    <p>Hi everyone! Let share with you a little bit about me. I'm from the south of Brazil, 
        my city borders Uruguay, so half of my family are Brazilians and half Uruguayans.</p>
    <p>But now I am living in SÃ£o Paulo and working at one of my favorite places, in Brazil MTC. 
        I have the opportunity to learn with missionaries everyday and feel closer to my Savior.</p>
    <p>I enjoy reading, cooking, working out, programming, and knonwing new places. I super exited for
        this semester, because I love working with technology and learning how to use it to help others.
         I knonw that it was created by God to help us share his gospel to whole world.</p>
         <p>Thank for looking at my web page!!!</p>
