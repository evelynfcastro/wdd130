            <p class="text">The Salmon River in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return,
             known as the "River of No Return" due to its rugged beauty that captivates visitors. 
             The area is rich in wildlife, including elk, deer, bears, and bighorn sheep, and it features towering 
             ponderosa pine trees along the riverbanks, offering shelter. The river has rapids ranging from class
             I to IV, and it is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. The water level varies 
             with the seasons, with higher, faster, and colder water in early summer and lower, slower, and warmer
             water in late summer, making it suitable for families with children who enjoy swimming.

            <p class="text">
                The Grand Canyon is the ultimate destination for river adventures, offering a combination of world-class
                 whitewater and awe-inspiring scenery. It promises an unforgettable experience, with thrilling rapids and 
                 the opportunity to explore side canyons and ancient Indian ruins that are accessible only by river. 
                 The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale from Class I to X (1 to 10)
                 to accommodate the wide range of rapids and river conditions, although many people are more familiar with 
                 the standard I to V rating scale.
